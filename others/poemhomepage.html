            <h1>How I started writing Poems</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hello guys I'm Vishvajit and this is one of the updates I've listed in the homepage(please refer to the homepage). So 
                        I like writing poems. How did I start writing poems? Let me tell you.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Well it was a fine morning and I was attending English class. The teacher had just finished reading the chapter and was doing the 
                        book excercises. And at this point, it so happened that there was a question asking you to write a poem about an Indian Summer.
                        Technically there was already a poem for an example. it went something like this:
                        <br>
                        <div class="italictext" style="font: italic; font-size: x-large;">
                                    Hot Days
                                    <br>
                                    Humid Afternoons
                                    <br>
                                    Pleasant Evenings
                                    <br>
                                    Cool Nights
                                    <br>
                                    Make an Indian summer!
                        </div>
                        Using my brain and full patience, in class time, was born my first ever poem. Practically writng poems is not at all hard. You just need
                        3 things.
                        <ol type="I">
                                    <li>Imagination</li>
                                    <li>A topic to write on</li>
                                    <li>Patience</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        Just before you go, give me some feedback after reading my poems!
                        <textarea name="feedback" id="feedback" cols="30" rows="10">Some compliment or feedback</textarea>
                        <a href="/poemspage.html">Submit</a>
            </p>
